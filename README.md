# Project Name
Trijunction design

## Research Goal
Manipulating Majoranas in a qubit requires coupling 3 or more Majoranas from different topological wires together (maybe not all at the same time).
Because Majorana wires require alignment with magnetic field, they have to also be parallel to each other.
Also because of the layout constraints, they have to be spatially separated.
The above factors combined, make the coupler design a nontrivial task.
That is exactly what we propose to do: investigate which geometries produce a good switch.
An extra advantage of this project is that it can be tested in the normal regime, bringing it within reach of ongoing experiments.
