	abstract = {Quantum information protected by the topology of the storage medium is expected to exhibit long coherence times. Another feature is topologically protected gates generated through braiding of Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, braiding requires structures with branched topological segments which have inherent difficulties in the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures now believed to host MBSs. In this paper, we construct quantum bits taking advantage of the topological protection and non-local properties of MBSs in a network of parallel wires, but without relying on braiding for quantum gates. The elementary unit is made from three topological wires, two wires coupled by a trivial superconductor and the third acting as an interference arm. Coulomb blockade of the combined wires spawns a fractionalized spin, non-locally addressable by quantum dots used for single-qubit readout, initialization, and manipulation. We describe how the same tools allow for measurement-based implementation of the Clifford gates, in total making the architecture universal. Proof-of-principle demonstration of topologically protected qubits using existing techniques is therefore within reach.},

	abstract = {Under appropriate external conditions a semiconductor nanowire in proximity to an s-wave superconductor can be in a topological superconducting (TS) phase. This phase supports localized zero-energy Majorana fermions at the ends of the wire. However, the non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana fermions is difficult to verify because of the one-dimensional topology of such wires. In this paper we propose a scheme to transport Majorana fermions between the ends of different wires using tunneling, which is shown to be controllable by gate voltages. Such tunneling-generated hops of Majorana fermions can be used to exchange the Majorana fermions. The exchange process thus obtained is described by a non-Abelian braid operator that is uniquely determined by the well-controlled microscopic tunneling parameters. {\copyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

@article{Leijnse2012,
	abstract = {This short review paper provides a pedagogical introduction to the rapidly growing research field of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We first discuss in some detail the simplest 'toy model' in which Majoranas appear, namely a one-dimensional tight-binding representation of a p-wave superconductor, introduced more than 10 years ago by Kitaev. We then give a general introduction to the remarkable properties of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems, such as their intrinsically non-local nature and exotic exchange statistics, and explain why these quasiparticles are suspected to be especially well suited for low-decoherence quantum information processing. We also discuss the experimentally promising (and perhaps already successfully realized) possibility of creating topological superconductors using semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, proximity-coupled to standard s-wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field. The goal is to provide an introduction to the subject for experimentalists or theorists who are new to the field, focusing on the aspects which are most important for understanding the basic physics. The text should be accessible for readers with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and second quantization, and does not require knowledge of quantum field theory or topological states of matter. {\copyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Schulenborg2021,
	abstract = {Quantum-dot based parity-to-charge conversion is a promising method for reading out quantum information encoded nonlocally into pairs of Majorana zero modes. To obtain a sizable parity-to-charge visibility, it is crucial to tune the relative phase of the tunnel couplings between the dot and the Majorana modes appropriately. However, in the presence of multiple quasi-degenerate dot orbitals, it is in general not experimentally feasible to tune all couplings individually. This paper shows that such configurations could make it difficult to avoid a destructive multi-orbital interference effect that substantially reduces the read-out visibility. We analyze this effect using a Lindblad quantum master equation. This exposes how the experimentally relevant system parameters enhance or suppress the visibility when strong charging energy, measurement dissipation and, most importantly, multi-orbital interference is accounted for. In particular, we find that an intermediate-time readout could mitigate some of the interference-related visibility reductions affecting the stationary limit.},

	abstract = {The proximity effect in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures, crucial for realizing Majorana edge modes, is complicated to control due to its dependence on many unknown microscopic parameters. In addition, defects can spoil the induced superconductivity locally in the proximitized system, which complicates measuring global properties with a local probe. We show how to use the nonlocal conductance between two spatially separated leads to probe three global properties of a proximitized system: the bulk superconducting gap, the induced gap, and the induced coherence length. Unlike local conductance spectroscopy, nonlocal conductance measurements distinguish between nontopological zero-energy modes localized around potential inhomogeneities, and true Majorana edge modes that emerge in the topological phase. In addition, we find that the nonlocal conductance is an odd function of bias at the topological phase transition, acting as a current rectifier in the low-bias limit. More generally, we identify conditions for crossed Andreev reflection to dominate the nonlocal conductance and show how to design a Cooper pair splitter in the open regime.},

The protocol is based on conductance measurements in a three-terminal device with two normal leads and one superconducting lead. A radio-frequency technique acts as a proxy for the measurement of local conductance, allowing a rapid, systematic scan of the large experimental phase space of the device. Majorana zero modes cause zero bias conductance peaks at each end of the wire, so we identify promising regions of the phase space by filtering for this condition. To validate the presence of a topological phase, a subsequent measurement of the non-local conductance in these regions is used to detect a topological transition via the closing and reopening of the bulk energy gap. We define data analysis routines that allow for an automated and unbiased execution of the protocol. Our protocol is designed to screen out false positives, especially trivial Andreev bound states that mimic Majorana zero modes in local conductance. We apply the protocol to several examples of simulated data illustrating the detection of topological phases and the screening of false positives.},

@article{Pan2021,
	abstract = {We develop a theory for the three-terminal nonlocal conductance in Majorana nanowires as existing in the superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures in the presence of superconducting proximity, spin-orbit coupling, and Zeeman splitting. The key question addressed is whether such nonlocal conductance can decisively distinguish between trivial and topological Majorana scenarios in the presence of chemical potential inhomogeneity and random impurity disorder. We calculate the local electrical as well as nonlocal electrical and thermal conductance of the pristine nanowire (good zero-bias conductance peaks), the nanowire in the presence of quantum dots and inhomogeneous potential (bad zero-bias conductance peaks), and the nanowire in the presence of large disorder (ugly zero-bias conductance peaks). The local conductance by itself is incapable of distinguishing the trivial states from the topological states since zero-bias conductance peaks are generic in the presence of disorder and inhomogeneous potential. The nonlocal conductance, which in principle is capable of providing the bulk gap closing and reopening information at the topological quantum phase transition, is found to be far too weak in magnitude to be particularly useful in the presence of disorder and inhomogeneous potential. Therefore, we focus on the question of whether the combination of the local, nonlocal electrical, and thermal conductance can separate the good, bad, and ugly zero-bias conductance peaks in finite-length wires. Our paper aims to provide a guide to future experiments, and we conclude that a combination of all three measurements would be necessary for a decisive demonstration of topological Majorana zero modes in nanowires - positive signals corresponding to just one kind of measurements are likely to be false positives arising from disorder and inhomogeneous potential.},

	abstract = { Andreev bound states in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices can have near-zero energy in the topologically trivial regime as long as the confinement potential is sufficiently smooth. These quasi-Majorana states show zero-bias conductance features in a topologically trivial phase, mimicking spatially separated topological Majorana states. We show that in addition to the suppressed coupling between the quasi-Majorana states, also the coupling of these states across a tunnel barrier to the outside is exponentially different for increasing magnetic field. As a consequence, quasi-Majorana states mimic most of the proposed Majorana signatures: quantized zero-bias peaks, the   4\pi   4 π     Josephson effect, and the tunneling spectrum in presence of a normal quantum dot. We identify a quantized conductance dip instead of a peak in the open regime as a distinguishing feature of true Majorana states in addition to having a bulk topological transition. Because braiding schemes rely only on the ability to couple to individual Majorana states, the exponential control over coupling strengths allows to also use quasi-Majorana states for braiding. Therefore, while the appearance of quasi-Majorana states complicates the observation of topological Majorana states, it opens an alternative route towards braiding of non-Abelian anyons and protected quantum computation. },

We analyze the previously disregarded role of electrostatic interaction in these devices. Our main result is that Coulomb interaction causes the chemical potential to respond to an applied magnetic field, while spin-orbit interaction and screening by the superconducting lead suppress this response. Consequently, the electrostatic environment influences two properties of Majorana devices: the shape of the topological phase boundary and the oscillations of the Majorana splitting energy. We demonstrate that both properties show a non-universal behavior, and depend on the details of the electrostatic environment. We show that when the wire only contains a single electron mode, the experimentally accessible inverse self-capacitance of this mode fully captures the interplay between electrostatics and Zeeman field.

In the current work, we provide specific experimental protocols for tunneling spectroscopy measurements to distinguish between Andreev and Majorana bound states without invoking more demanding nonlocal measurements which have not yet been successfully performed in nanowire systems. In particular, we discuss three distinct experimental schemes involving the response of the zero-bias peak to local perturbations of the tunnel barrier, the overlap of bound states from the wire ends, and, most compellingly, introducing a sharp localized potential in the wire itself to perturb the zero-bias tunneling peaks.

The coupling of the MBSs can be tuned for both types in a wide range (<1neV to >10μeV) using gates placed adjacent to the stripes. For both types, we numerically compute the local density of states for two parallel Majorana-stripe ends as well as Majorana trijunctions formed in a tuning-fork geometry. The MBS coupling between parallel Majorana stripes can be suppressed below 1 neV for potential barriers in the meV range for separations of about 200 nm. We further show that the MBS couplings in a trijunction can be gate controlled in a range similar to the intrastripe coupling while maintaining a sizable gap to the excited states (tens of μeV). Altogether, this suggests that braiding can carried out on a time scale of 10-100 ns.},

@article{Clarke2016,
	abstract = {Carrying out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using non-Abelian anyons (e.g., Majorana zero modes) is currently an important goal of worldwide experimental efforts. However, the Gottesman- Knill theorem [1] holds that if a system can only perform a certain subset of available quantum operations (i.e., operations from the Clifford group) in addition to the preparation and detection of qubit states in the computational basis, then that system is insufficient for universal quantum computation. Indeed, any measurement results in such a system could be reproduced within a local hidden variable theory, so there is no need for a quantum-mechanical explanation and therefore no possibility of quantum speedup [2]. Unfortunately, Clifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and measurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are otherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum computation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an additional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate the Bell-like Clauser- Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable theory. In this article, we introduce a new type of phase gate for the already-existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems and demonstrate how this phase gate may be benchmarked using CHSH measurements. We present an experimentally feasible schematic for such an experiment using a "measurement-only" approach that bypasses the need for explicit Majorana braiding. This approach may be scaled beyond the two-qubit system necessary for CHSH violations, leading to a well-defined platform for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes.},

Even though the operations are not topologically protected, the proposed experiment can potentially shed light on the coherence of the parity degree of freedom in Majorana devices and serve as a first step towards topological Majorana qubits. We discuss in detail the charge-stability diagram and its use for characterizing the parameters of the devices, including the overlap of the Majorana edge states. We describe the multilevel spectral properties of the system and present a detailed study of its controlled coherent oscillations, as well as decoherence resulting from coupling to a non-Markovian environment. In particular, we study a gate-controlled protocol where conversion between Coulomb-blockade and transmon regimes generates coherent oscillations of the qubit state due to the overlap of Majorana modes. We show that, in addition to fluctuations of the Majorana coupling, considerable measurement errors may be accumulated during the conversion intervals when electrostatic fluctuations in the superconducting islands are present.

The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from any reservoir and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement. The combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved, and charge transfer between the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunneling. Resonance is controlled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy splitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wave functions. The latter splitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite value by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that the oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to readout but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot potential. With experimentally realistic parameters, we find that high-fidelity parity readout is achievable given nanometer-scale spatial control of the MBS and that there is a trade-off between required precisions of temporal and spatial control. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus separation would present a clear signature of topological order and could be used to test the robustness of this order to spatial motion, a key requirement in certain schemes for scalable topological qubits. We show how the scheme can be extended to distinguish valid parity measurements from invalid ones due to gate calibration errors.},

Surprisingly, this resonance pinning, resembling, in this sense, a "Kondo resonance," occurs even when the gate-controlled dot level εdot(Vg) is far above or far below εF. The calculated conductance G of the dot exhibits an unambiguous signature for the Majorana end mode of the wire: In essence, an off-resonance dot [εdot(Vg)≠εF], which should have G=0, shows, instead, a conductance e2/2h over a wide range of Vg due to this pinned dot mode.

Coherent detection and manipulation of such states in scalable devices are, therefore, essential in these applications. Recent detection proposals include semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) coupled to the end of these wires, as changes in the QD electronic spectral density due to the MZM coupling could be detected in transport experiments. Here, we propose that multi-QD systems can also be used to manipulate MZMs through precise control over the QDs' parameters. The simplest case where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot (DQD) geometry. By using exact analytical methods and numerical renormalization-group calculations, we show that the QDs' spectral functions can be used to characterize the presence or not of MZMs "leaking" into the DQD. More importantly, we find that these signatures respond to changes in the DQD parameters such as gate voltages and couplings in a consistent fashion. Additionally, we show that different MZM-DQD coupling geometries ("symmetric," "in-series," and "T-shaped" junctions) offer distinct ways in which MZMs can be switched from dot to dot. These results highlight the interesting possibilities that DQDs offer for all-electrical MZM control in scalable devices.},

	abstract = {We analyze analytically, semianalytically, and numerically the operation of a cross-resonance (CR) gate for superconducting qubits (transmons). We find that a relatively simple semianalytical method gives accurate results for the controlled-not (cnot) -equivalent gate duration and compensating single-qubit rotations. It also allows us to minimize the cnot gate duration over the amplitude of the applied microwave drive and find the dependence on the detuning between the qubits. However, full numerical simulations are needed to calculate the intrinsic fidelity of the CR gate. We decompose numerical infidelity into contributions from various physical mechanisms, thus finding the intrinsic error budget. In particular, at small drive amplitudes, the CR gate fidelity is limited by imperfections of the target-qubit rotations, while at large amplitudes it is limited by leakage. The gate duration and fidelity are analyzed numerically as functions of the detuning between qubits, their coupling, drive frequency, relative duration of pulse ramps, and microwave crosstalk. The effect of the echo sequence is also analyzed numerically. Our results show that the CR gate can provide intrinsic infidelity of less than 10-3 when a simple pulse shape is used.},

	abstract = {A hallmark of topological superconductivity is the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana bound states (MBS), its chargeless zero-energy emergent quasiparticles. The resulting fractionalization of a single electron, stored nonlocally as a two spatially separated MBS, provides a powerful platform for implementing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. However, despite intensive efforts, experimental support for MBS remains indirect and does not probe their non-Abelian statistics. Here we propose how to overcome this obstacle in mini-gate controlled planar Josephson junctions (JJ) and demonstrate non-Abelian statistics through MBS fusion, detected by charge sensing using a quantum point contact. The feasibility of preparing, manipulating, and fusing MBS in two-dimensional (2D) systems is supported in our experiments which demonstrate the control of superconducting properties with five mini gates in InAs/Al-based JJs. While we focus on this well-established platform, where the topological superconductivity was already experimentally detected, our proposal to identify elusive non-Abelian statistics motivates also further MBS studies in other gate-controlled 2D systems.},

@article{Lai2021,
	abstract = {Despite recent experimental progress towards observing large zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCP) as signatures of Majorana modes, confusion remains about whether Majorana modes have been observed. This is in part due to the theoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial zero-bias peaks that occur because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials. While many aspects of the topological phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because the topological phase space is often small, the quantized height of ZBCPs associated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low temperatures even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small normal-state conductance. In this work, we study whether this counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this end, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor F to quantify the robustness of the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state conductance over which the ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By computing this quality factor F together with the topological characteristics for a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are significantly more robust compared with non-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature as high as the experimentally used 20 mK, we find that we can set a threshold value of F~2 so that ZBCPs associated with a quality factor F>2 are likely topological and F<<2 are topologically trivial. More precisely, the value of F is operationally related to the degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system although F uses only the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we discuss how the quality factor F measured in a transport set-up can help estimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes.},

	abstract = {Semiconducting quantum wires defined within two-dimensional electron gases and strongly coupled to thin superconducting layers have been extensively explored in recent experiments as promising platforms to host Majorana bound states. We study numerically such a geometry, consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional wire coupled to a disordered three-dimensional superconducting layer. We find that, in the strong-coupling limit of a sizable proximity-induced superconducting gap, all transverse subbands of the wire are significantly shifted in energy relative to the chemical potential of the wire. For the lowest subband, this band shift is comparable in magnitude to the spacing between quantized levels that arises due to the finite thickness of the superconductor (which typically is ∼500 meV for a 10-nm-thick layer of aluminum); in higher subbands, the band shift is much larger. Additionally, we show that the width of the system, which is usually much larger than the thickness, and moderate disorder within the superconductor have almost no impact on the induced gap or band shift. We provide a detailed discussion of the ramifications of our results, arguing that a huge band shift and significant renormalization of semiconducting material parameters in the strong-coupling limit make it challenging to realize a topological phase in such a setup, as the strong coupling to the superconductor essentially metallizes the semiconductor. This metallization of the semiconductor can be tested experimentally through the measurement of the band shift.},

The value of the conductance depends on the manner in which the leads are attached to the cavity. The Fourier transform of the transmission amplitudes is compared with the length of the classical paths. There is good agreement between classical and quantum mechanical results when the conductance is achieved mainly by special short-lived states such as whispering gallery modes and bouncing ball modes. In these cases, also the localization of the wave functions agrees with the picture of the classical paths. The S matrix is calculated classically and compared with the transmission coefficients of the quantum mechanical calculations for five modes in each lead.

In addition, we calculate the Fano factor versus cutoff length of classical trajectories in the energy domain to illustrate that the fluctuations in transmission amplitude mainly arise from the contribution of short-length classical trajectories. We further show that the transmission length power spectra not only associate with a lot of classical trajectories but with a series of nonclassical trajectories due to the diffraction scattering effects.

Here, we instead discuss the analogous problem on a model \textit\{Luttinger\} surface, or contour of \textit\{zeros\} of the Green function. At zero temperature ($\beta \rightarrow \infty$) and a critical interaction strength ($u_\{c\infty\}$) characterized by the residue of self-energy pole, we find that the pair susceptibility diverges leading to a superconducting instability. We evaluate the pair fluctuation partition function and find that the spectral density in the normal state has an interaction-driven, power-law $\frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{\omega\}\}$ type, van-Hove singularity (vHS) indicating non-Fermi liquid (NFL) physics. Crucially, in the strong coupling limit ($\beta u \gg 1$), the leading order fluctuation free energy terms in the normal state of this NFL-SC transition resemble the equivalent $\left(O(1)\right)$ terms of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. This free energy contribution takes a simple form $-\beta F = \beta u_\{c\infty\} - \gamma~\text\{ln\}\left(\beta u_\{c \infty\}\right)$ where $\gamma$ is a constant equal to $\frac\{1\}\{2\}$. Weak impurity scattering ($\tau \gg \beta^\{-1\}$) leaves the low-energy spectral density unaffected, but leads to an interaction-driven enhancement of superconductivity.
