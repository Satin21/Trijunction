\chapter{Coupling of two Majorana bound states}

In this chapter we discuss the coupling of two MBS using a quantum dot and the role of the superconducting phase difference in a topological Josephson junction.

\section{Topological Josephson junctions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A Josephson junction is a S-N-S junction where the excitation spectra is controlled by the flux, $\Phi$, with $2\pi$ periodicity.
\item A Josephson junction made with topological superconductors is $4\pi$ periodic as a consequence of the presence of a zero-energy fermionic mode made of two MBS.
\item While the frequency is fixed, the phase shift is determined by the complex part of the hopping term between the two structures, which in our case is given by the 
\item Control of the normal section as a quantum dot allows for the MBS to couple with a maximum at $\varphi = \pi$.
\item If the two superconductor are in a parallel geometry, chiral symmetry is required to couple the MBS.
