@article{Shabani2015,
	abstract = {Progress in the emergent field of topological superconductivity relies on synthesis of new material combinations, combining superconductivity, low density, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For example, theory [1-4] indicates that the interface between a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor (Sm) with strong SOC and a superconductor (S) hosts Majorana modes with nontrivial topological properties [5-8]. Recently, epitaxial growth of Al on InAs nanowires was shown to yield a high quality S-Sm system with uniformly transparent interfaces [9] and a hard induced gap, indicted by strongly suppressed sub gap tunneling conductance [10]. Here we report the realization of a two-dimensional (2D) InAs/InGaAs heterostructure with epitaxial Al, yielding a planar S-Sm system with structural and transport characteristics as good as the epitaxial wires. The realization of 2D epitaxial S-Sm systems represent a significant advance over wires, allowing extended networks via top-down processing. Among numerous potential applications, this new material system can serve as a platform for complex networks of topological superconductors with gate-controlled Majorana zero modes [1-4]. We demonstrate gateable Josephson junctions and a highly transparent 2D S-Sm interface based on the product of excess current and normal state resistance.},

@article{Zeng2020,
	abstract = {We discuss the feasibility of measurement-based braiding in semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructures in the so-called quasi-Majorana regime $-$ the topologically-trivial regime due to partially-separated Andreev bound states (ps-ABSs). These low energy ABSs consist of component Majorana bound states (quasi-Majorana modes) that are spatially separated by a length scale smaller than the length of the system, in contrast with the Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which are separated by the length of the wire. In the quasi-Majorana regime, the ZBCPs appear to be robust to various perturbations as long as the energy splitting of the ps-ABS is less than the typical width $\e_w$ of the low-energy conductance peaks $\e_w$. However, the feasibility of measurement-based braiding depends on a different energy scale $\e_m$. In this paper we show that it is possible to prepare the SM-SC system in the quasi-Majorana regime with energy splittings below the $\e_m$ threshold, so that measurement-based braiding is possible in principle. Starting with ps-ABSs with energy below $\e_m$, we identify the maximum amplitudes of different types of perturbations that are consistent with perturbation-induced energy splittings not exceeding the $\e_m$ limit. We argue that measurements generating perturbations larger than the threshold amplitudes appropriate for $\e_m$ cannot realize measurement-based braiding in SM-SC heterostructures in the quasi-Majorana regime. We find that, if possible at all, quantum computation using measurement-based braiding in the quasi-Majorana regime would be plagued with errors introduced by the measurement processes themselves, while such errors are significantly less likely in a scheme involving topological MZMs.},

	abstract = {Quantum computation by non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZMs) offers an approach to achieve fault tolerance by encoding quantum information in the non-local charge parity states of semiconductor nanowire networks in the topological superconductor regime. Thus far, experimental studies of MZMs chiefly relied on single electron tunneling measurements which leads to decoherence of the quantum information stored in the MZM. As a next step towards topological quantum computation, charge parity conserving experiments based on the Josephson effect are required, which can also help exclude suggested non-topological origins of the zero bias conductance anomaly. Here we report the direct measurement of the Josephson radiation frequency in InAs nanowires with epitaxial aluminium shells. For the first time, we observe the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect above a magnetic field of $\approx 200\,$mT, consistent with the estimated and measured topological phase transition of similar devices.},

	abstract = {Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states (MBSs). We demonstrate the emergence of MBSs from coalescing Andreev bound states (ABSs) in a hybrid InAs nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.},

@article{Gharavi2016,
	abstract = {We theoretically examine a scheme for projectively reading out the parity state of a pair of Majorana bound states (MBS) using a tunnel coupled quantum dot. The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from any reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement. The combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer between the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is controlled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy splitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter splitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite value by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that the oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to readout, but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot potential. With experimentally realistic parameters, we find that high-fidelity parity readout is achievable given nanometer-scale spatial control of the MBS, and that there is a tradeoff between required precisions of temporal and spatial control. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus separation would present a clear signature of topological order, and could be used to test the robustness of this order to spatial motion, a key requirement in certain schemes for scalable topological qubits. We show how the scheme can be extended to distinguish valid parity measurements from invalid ones due to gate calibration errors.},

@report{Nielsen2001,
	abstract = {What resources are universal for quantum com-putation? In the standard model, a quantum computer consists of a sequence of unitary gates acting coherently on the qubits making up the computer. This paper shows that a very different model involving only projective measurements, quantum memory, and the ability to prepare the |0 state is also universal for quantum computation. In particular, no coherent unitary dynamics are involved in the computation. Recall that in the standard quantum circuits model (see, for example, [1,2] for a review) a quantum computation consists of three elements: (a) an initialization stage in which the computer is prepared in an n-qubit computational basis state; (b) a processing stage in which a sequence of one-and two-qubit unitary gates is applied to the computer; and (c) a read-out stage in which the result of the computation is read out by measuring some subset of the qubits in the computational basis. This paper demonstrates that a surprising alternate model is also universal for quantum computation. In this measurement model for quantum computation only the following three operations are allowed: (a) preparation of qubits in the |0 state; (b) storage of qubits (quantum memory); and (c) (non-destructive) projective measurements on up to four qubits at a time, in an arbitrary basis. What is surprising about the universality of this model is that no coherent dynamical operations are allowed, contrary to the widespread folklore belief that such operations are crucial to universal quantum computation. Substantial prior work has been done on the physical requirements for universal quantum computation. Barenco et al [3] showed that controlled-not and single-qubit unitary operations are sufficient to do universal quantum computation. Deutsch, Ekert and Barenco [4] and Lloyd [5] showed that almost any two-qubit quantum gate is universal. More recently, Dodd et al [6] have shown that any two-body Hamiltonian entangling qubits, together with local unitary operations, is universal for computation. (See also related work in [7-10].) Thus, the conventional approach to universality has been to identify a set of coherent dynamical operations universal for quantum computation. Recently, however, it has been realized that quantum measurement is a powerful primitive element that can be performed during a computation. For example, Raussendorf and Briegel [11] have shown that by combining quantum measurements with the ability to prepare a special "cluster" state using a coherent Ising-type interaction, it is possible to do universal quantum computation. Knill, Laflamme and Mil-burn [12] have shown that single-photon detection and single-photon sources enable universal quantum computation in optics, using otherwise relatively easy coherent dynamical operations from linear optics. In this paper I extend these results to show that no coherent dynamics at all are required to do universal quantum computation. The results of this paper build on a method developed by Nielsen and Chuang [13], who showed how to stochastically "teleport" a quantum gate from one location to another. Elegant generalizations of this method have been developed in [14-17]. The method has also been applied by Gottesman and Chuang [18] to develop fault-tolerant constructions for quantum gates, and further work [19] has been done simplifying such constructions. Note also that the optical quantum computer proposed by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn [12] is based on the gate teleportation idea. In order to show that the measurement model can simulate the standard model of quantum computation we need only show that the measurement model can simulate the controlled-not gate, as well as any single-qubit uni-tary gate. We begin by explaining how the measurement model can simulate the action of an arbitrary single-qubit gate U on a single-qubit state |ψ. The first step is to use the measurement model to prepare one of the two-qubit states |U j defined by |U j ≡ (I ⊗ U σ j)(|00 + |11)/ √ 2, where σ j are the four Pauli σ matrices, I, σ x , σ y , and σ z. Simple algebra shows that these states form an orthonormal basis for the state space of two qubits, so we can achieve this state preparation by first preparing the state |00, and then measuring in the orthonormal basis of states |U j. It is important to note that the construction presented below works no matter which of the four states |U j is output from this measurement procedure. Having prepared the state |U j offline, we now attempt to use this state and Bell-basis measurements to perform the operation U on |ψ. The basic operation required to achieve this is the gate teleportation circuit shown in},

For instance, one route toward realizing topological matter is by coupling a 2D electron gas (2DEG) with strong spin-orbit interaction to an s-wave superconductor. Previous efforts along these lines have been hindered by interface disorder and unstable gating. Here, we report measurements on a gateable InGaAs/InAs 2DEG with patterned epitaxial Al, yielding multilayer devices with atomically pristine interfaces between semiconductor and superconductor. Using surface gates to form a quantum point contact (QPC), we find a hard superconducting gap in the tunneling regime, overcoming the soft-gap problem in 2D superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems. With the QPC in the open regime, we observe a first conductance plateau at 4e^2/h, as expected theoretically for a normal-QPC-superconductor structure. The realization of a hard-gap semiconductor-superconductor system that is amenable to top-down processing provides a means of fabricating scalable multicomponent hybrid systems for applications in low-dissipation electronics and topological quantum information.},

	abstract = {A semiconducting nanowire proximitized by an $s$-wave superconductor can be tuned into a topological state by an applied magnetic field. This quantum phase transition is marked by the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the ends of the wire. The fusion of Majorana modes at a junction between two nanowires results in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. We elucidate how the $4\pi$-periodicity arises across the topological phase transition in a highly-transparent short nanowire junction. Owing to a high transmission coefficient, Majorana zero modes coming from different wires are strongly coupled, with an energy scale set by the proximity-induced, field-independent pairing potential. At the same time, the topological spectral gap---defined by competition between superconducting correlations and Zeeman splitting---becomes narrow in the vicinity of the transition point. The resulting hybridization of the fused Majorana states with the spectral continuum strongly affects the electron density of states at the junction and its Josephson energy. We study the manifestations of this hybridization in the energy spectrum and phase dependence of the Josephson current. We pinpoint the experimentally observable signatures of the topological phase transition, focusing on junctions with weak backscattering.},

Experimental advances in this field have often been triggered by the development of new hybrid material systems. Among these, two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest due to their inherent design flexibility and scalability. Here we discuss results on a 2D platform based on a ternary 2DEG (InSbAs) coupled to in-situ grown Aluminum. The spin-orbit coupling in these 2DEGs can be tuned with the As concentration, reaching values up to 400 meV$\unicode\{xC5\}$, thus exceeding typical values measured in its binary constituents. In addition to a large Land\'e g-factor $\sim$ 55 (comparable to InSb), we show that the clean superconductor-semiconductor interface leads to a hard induced superconducting gap. Using this new platform we demonstrate the basic operation of phase-controllable Josephson junctions, superconducting islands and quasi-1D systems, prototypical device geometries used to study Majorana zero modes.},

	abstract = {Superconductivity results from an instability of the Fermi surface -- contour of \textit\{poles\} of the single particle propagator -- to an infinitesimally small attraction between electrons. Here, we instead discuss the analogous problem on a model \textit\{Luttinger\} surface, or contour of \textit\{zeros\} of the Green function. At zero temperature ($\beta \rightarrow \infty$) and a critical interaction strength ($u_\{c\infty\}$) characterized by the residue of self-energy pole, we find that the pair susceptibility diverges leading to a superconducting instability. We evaluate the pair fluctuation partition function and find that the spectral density in the normal state has an interaction-driven, power-law $\frac\{1\}\{\sqrt\{\omega\}\}$ type, van-Hove singularity (vHS) indicating non-Fermi liquid (NFL) physics. Crucially, in the strong coupling limit ($\beta u \gg 1$), the leading order fluctuation free energy terms in the normal state of this NFL-SC transition resemble the equivalent $\left(O(1)\right)$ terms of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. This free energy contribution takes a simple form $-\beta F = \beta u_\{c\infty\} - \gamma~\text\{ln\}\left(\beta u_\{c \infty\}\right)$ where $\gamma$ is a constant equal to $\frac\{1\}\{2\}$. Weak impurity scattering ($\tau \gg \beta^\{-1\}$) leaves the low-energy spectral density unaffected, but leads to an interaction-driven enhancement of superconductivity. Our results shed light on the role played by order-parameter fluctuations in providing the key missing link between Mott physics and strongly coupled toy-models exhibiting gravity duals.},

We study the topological quantum phase transition in this system and analytically calculate the phase diagram as a function of the chemical potential and magnetic field. Our key finding is that multiband occupancy not only lifts the stringent constraint of one-dimensionality but also allows to have higher carrier density in the nanowire and as such multisubband nanowires are better-suited for observing the Majorana particle. We study the robustness of the topological phase by including the effects of the short- and long-range disorder. We show that in the limit of strong interband mixing there is an optimal regime in the phase diagram ("sweet spot") where the topological state is to a large extent insensitive to the presence of disorder.},

By defining the interference factor and comparing it numerically with the transmission amplitude, we demonstrate that the fluctuations in transmission amplitude are mainly due to the interference effects between different classical trajectories. In addition, we calculate the Fano factor versus cutoff length of classical trajectories in the energy domain to illustrate that the fluctuations in transmission amplitude mainly arise from the contribution of short-length classical trajectories. We further show that the transmission length power spectra not only associate with a lot of classical trajectories but with a series of nonclassical trajectories due to the diffraction scattering effects. Moreover, we show that the classical trajectories distributed in the mode-mode coupling function give the largest contribution to the corresponding transmission amplitude. We hope that our results and analysis can be used to reveal new effects of mesoscopic systems and to provide theoretical basis for the design of mesoscopic devices.},

The value of the conductance depends on the manner in which the leads are attached to the cavity. The Fourier transform of the transmission amplitudes is compared with the length of the classical paths. There is good agreement between classical and quantum mechanical results when the conductance is achieved mainly by special short-lived states such as whispering gallery modes and bouncing ball modes. In these cases, also the localization of the wave functions agrees with the picture of the classical paths. The S matrix is calculated classically and compared with the transmission coefficients of the quantum mechanical calculations for five modes in each lead.

We study numerically such a geometry, consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional wire coupled to a disordered three-dimensional superconducting layer. We find that, in the strong-coupling limit of a sizable proximity-induced superconducting gap, all transverse subbands of the wire are significantly shifted in energy relative to the chemical potential of the wire. For the lowest subband, this band shift is comparable in magnitude to the spacing between quantized levels that arises due to the finite thickness of the superconductor (which typically is ∼500 meV for a 10-nm-thick layer of aluminum); in higher subbands, the band shift is much larger. Additionally, we show that the width of the system, which is usually much larger than the thickness, and moderate disorder within the superconductor have almost no impact on the induced gap or band shift. We provide a detailed discussion of the ramifications of our results, arguing that a huge band shift and significant renormalization of semiconducting material parameters in the strong-coupling limit make it challenging to realize a topological phase in such a setup, as the strong coupling to the superconductor essentially metallizes the semiconductor. This metallization of the semiconductor can be tested experimentally through the measurement of the band shift.},

@article{Lai2021,
	abstract = {Despite recent experimental progress towards observing large zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCP) as signatures of Majorana modes, confusion remains about whether Majorana modes have been observed. This is in part due to the theoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial zero-bias peaks that occur because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials. While many aspects of the topological phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because the topological phase space is often small, the quantized height of ZBCPs associated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low temperatures even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small normal-state conductance. In this work, we study whether this counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this end, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor F to quantify the robustness of the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state conductance over which the ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By computing this quality factor F together with the topological characteristics for a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are significantly more robust compared with non-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature as high as the experimentally used 20 mK, we find that we can set a threshold value of F~2 so that ZBCPs associated with a quality factor F>2 are likely topological and F<<2 are topologically trivial. More precisely, the value of F is operationally related to the degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system although F uses only the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we discuss how the quality factor F measured in a transport set-up can help estimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes.},

The resulting fractionalization of a single electron, stored nonlocally as a two spatially separated MBS, provides a powerful platform for implementing fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. However, despite intensive efforts, experimental support for MBS remains indirect and does not probe their non-Abelian statistics. Here we propose how to overcome this obstacle in mini-gate controlled planar Josephson junctions (JJ) and demonstrate non-Abelian statistics through MBS fusion, detected by charge sensing using a quantum point contact. The feasibility of preparing, manipulating, and fusing MBS in two-dimensional (2D) systems is supported in our experiments which demonstrate the control of superconducting properties with five mini gates in InAs/Al-based JJs. While we focus on this well-established platform, where the topological superconductivity was already experimentally detected, our proposal to identify elusive non-Abelian statistics motivates also further MBS studies in other gate-controlled 2D systems.},

Coherent detection and manipulation of such states in scalable devices are, therefore, essential in these applications. Recent detection proposals include semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) coupled to the end of these wires, as changes in the QD electronic spectral density due to the MZM coupling could be detected in transport experiments. Here, we propose that multi-QD systems can also be used to manipulate MZMs through precise control over the QDs' parameters. The simplest case where Majorana manipulation is possible is in a double quantum dot (DQD) geometry. By using exact analytical methods and numerical renormalization-group calculations, we show that the QDs' spectral functions can be used to characterize the presence or not of MZMs "leaking" into the DQD. More importantly, we find that these signatures respond to changes in the DQD parameters such as gate voltages and couplings in a consistent fashion. Additionally, we show that different MZM-DQD coupling geometries ("symmetric," "in-series," and "T-shaped" junctions) offer distinct ways in which MZMs can be switched from dot to dot. These results highlight the interesting possibilities that DQDs offer for all-electrical MZM control in scalable devices.},

Surprisingly, this resonance pinning, resembling, in this sense, a "Kondo resonance," occurs even when the gate-controlled dot level εdot(Vg) is far above or far below εF. The calculated conductance G of the dot exhibits an unambiguous signature for the Majorana end mode of the wire: In essence, an off-resonance dot [εdot(Vg)≠εF], which should have G=0, shows, instead, a conductance e2/2h over a wide range of Vg due to this pinned dot mode. Interestingly, this pinning effect only occurs when the dot level is coupled to a Majorana mode; ordinary fermionic modes (e.g., disorder) in the wire simply split and broaden (if a continuum) the dot level.

Even though the operations are not topologically protected, the proposed experiment can potentially shed light on the coherence of the parity degree of freedom in Majorana devices and serve as a first step towards topological Majorana qubits. We discuss in detail the charge-stability diagram and its use for characterizing the parameters of the devices, including the overlap of the Majorana edge states. We describe the multilevel spectral properties of the system and present a detailed study of its controlled coherent oscillations, as well as decoherence resulting from coupling to a non-Markovian environment. In particular, we study a gate-controlled protocol where conversion between Coulomb-blockade and transmon regimes generates coherent oscillations of the qubit state due to the overlap of Majorana modes. We show that, in addition to fluctuations of the Majorana coupling, considerable measurement errors may be accumulated during the conversion intervals when electrostatic fluctuations in the superconducting islands are present.

	abstract = {Carrying out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using non-Abelian anyons (e.g., Majorana zero modes) is currently an important goal of worldwide experimental efforts. However, the Gottesman- Knill theorem [1] holds that if a system can only perform a certain subset of available quantum operations (i.e., operations from the Clifford group) in addition to the preparation and detection of qubit states in the computational basis, then that system is insufficient for universal quantum computation. Indeed, any measurement results in such a system could be reproduced within a local hidden variable theory, so there is no need for a quantum-mechanical explanation and therefore no possibility of quantum speedup [2]. Unfortunately, Clifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and measurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are otherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum computation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an additional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate the Bell-like Clauser- Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable theory. In this article, we introduce a new type of phase gate for the already-existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems and demonstrate how this phase gate may be benchmarked using CHSH measurements. We present an experimentally feasible schematic for such an experiment using a "measurement-only" approach that bypasses the need for explicit Majorana braiding. This approach may be scaled beyond the two-qubit system necessary for CHSH violations, leading to a well-defined platform for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using Majorana zero modes.},

The coupling of the MBSs can be tuned for both types in a wide range (<1neV to >10μeV) using gates placed adjacent to the stripes. For both types, we numerically compute the local density of states for two parallel Majorana-stripe ends as well as Majorana trijunctions formed in a tuning-fork geometry. The MBS coupling between parallel Majorana stripes can be suppressed below 1 neV for potential barriers in the meV range for separations of about 200 nm. We further show that the MBS couplings in a trijunction can be gate controlled in a range similar to the intrastripe coupling while maintaining a sizable gap to the excited states (tens of μeV). Altogether, this suggests that braiding can carried out on a time scale of 10-100 ns.},

@article{Vuik2019,
	abstract = { Andreev bound states in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices can have near-zero energy in the topologically trivial regime as long as the confinement potential is sufficiently smooth. These quasi-Majorana states show zero-bias conductance features in a topologically trivial phase, mimicking spatially separated topological Majorana states. We show that in addition to the suppressed coupling between the quasi-Majorana states, also the coupling of these states across a tunnel barrier to the outside is exponentially different for increasing magnetic field. As a consequence, quasi-Majorana states mimic most of the proposed Majorana signatures: quantized zero-bias peaks, the   4\pi   4 π     Josephson effect, and the tunneling spectrum in presence of a normal quantum dot. We identify a quantized conductance dip instead of a peak in the open regime as a distinguishing feature of true Majorana states in addition to having a bulk topological transition. Because braiding schemes rely only on the ability to couple to individual Majorana states, the exponential control over coupling strengths allows to also use quasi-Majorana states for braiding. Therefore, while the appearance of quasi-Majorana states complicates the observation of topological Majorana states, it opens an alternative route towards braiding of non-Abelian anyons and protected quantum computation. },

Topological quantum computation was discussed so far as manipulation of the wave function within degenerate many-body ground state. The simplest particles providing degenerate ground state, Majorana fermions, often coexist with extremely low-energy excitations so keeping the system in the ground state may be hard. We show that the topological protection extends to the excited states, as long as the Majorana fermions do not interact neither directly nor via the excited states. This protection relies on the fermion parity conservation and so it is generic to any implementation of Majorana fermions. {\copyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {We develop a theory for the three-terminal nonlocal conductance in Majorana nanowires as existing in the superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures in the presence of superconducting proximity, spin-orbit coupling, and Zeeman splitting. The key question addressed is whether such nonlocal conductance can decisively distinguish between trivial and topological Majorana scenarios in the presence of chemical potential inhomogeneity and random impurity disorder. We calculate the local electrical as well as nonlocal electrical and thermal conductance of the pristine nanowire (good zero-bias conductance peaks), the nanowire in the presence of quantum dots and inhomogeneous potential (bad zero-bias conductance peaks), and the nanowire in the presence of large disorder (ugly zero-bias conductance peaks). The local conductance by itself is incapable of distinguishing the trivial states from the topological states since zero-bias conductance peaks are generic in the presence of disorder and inhomogeneous potential. The nonlocal conductance, which in principle is capable of providing the bulk gap closing and reopening information at the topological quantum phase transition, is found to be far too weak in magnitude to be particularly useful in the presence of disorder and inhomogeneous potential. Therefore, we focus on the question of whether the combination of the local, nonlocal electrical, and thermal conductance can separate the good, bad, and ugly zero-bias conductance peaks in finite-length wires. Our paper aims to provide a guide to future experiments, and we conclude that a combination of all three measurements would be necessary for a decisive demonstration of topological Majorana zero modes in nanowires - positive signals corresponding to just one kind of measurements are likely to be false positives arising from disorder and inhomogeneous potential.},

	abstract = {We develop a protocol to determine the presence and extent of a topological phase with Majorana zero modes in a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor device. The protocol is based on conductance measurements in a three-terminal device with two normal leads and one superconducting lead. A radio-frequency technique acts as a proxy for the measurement of local conductance, allowing a rapid, systematic scan of the large experimental phase space of the device. Majorana zero modes cause zero bias conductance peaks at each end of the wire, so we identify promising regions of the phase space by filtering for this condition. To validate the presence of a topological phase, a subsequent measurement of the non-local conductance in these regions is used to detect a topological transition via the closing and reopening of the bulk energy gap. We define data analysis routines that allow for an automated and unbiased execution of the protocol. Our protocol is designed to screen out false positives, especially trivial Andreev bound states that mimic Majorana zero modes in local conductance. We apply the protocol to several examples of simulated data illustrating the detection of topological phases and the screening of false positives.},

In particular, we show that the local and the nonlocal elements of the conductance matrix have pairwise identical antisymmetric components.

	abstract = {The proximity effect in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures, crucial for realizing Majorana edge modes, is complicated to control due to its dependence on many unknown microscopic parameters. In addition, defects can spoil the induced superconductivity locally in the proximitized system, which complicates measuring global properties with a local probe. We show how to use the nonlocal conductance between two spatially separated leads to probe three global properties of a proximitized system: the bulk superconducting gap, the induced gap, and the induced coherence length. Unlike local conductance spectroscopy, nonlocal conductance measurements distinguish between nontopological zero-energy modes localized around potential inhomogeneities, and true Majorana edge modes that emerge in the topological phase. In addition, we find that the nonlocal conductance is an odd function of bias at the topological phase transition, acting as a current rectifier in the low-bias limit. More generally, we identify conditions for crossed Andreev reflection to dominate the nonlocal conductance and show how to design a Cooper pair splitter in the open regime.},

	abstract = {Quantum-dot based parity-to-charge conversion is a promising method for reading out quantum information encoded nonlocally into pairs of Majorana zero modes. To obtain a sizable parity-to-charge visibility, it is crucial to tune the relative phase of the tunnel couplings between the dot and the Majorana modes appropriately. However, in the presence of multiple quasi-degenerate dot orbitals, it is in general not experimentally feasible to tune all couplings individually. This paper shows that such configurations could make it difficult to avoid a destructive multi-orbital interference effect that substantially reduces the read-out visibility. We analyze this effect using a Lindblad quantum master equation. This exposes how the experimentally relevant system parameters enhance or suppress the visibility when strong charging energy, measurement dissipation and, most importantly, multi-orbital interference is accounted for. In particular, we find that an intermediate-time readout could mitigate some of the interference-related visibility reductions affecting the stationary limit.},

We first discuss in some detail the simplest 'toy model' in which Majoranas appear, namely a one-dimensional tight-binding representation of a p-wave superconductor, introduced more than 10 years ago by Kitaev. We then give a general introduction to the remarkable properties of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems, such as their intrinsically non-local nature and exotic exchange statistics, and explain why these quasiparticles are suspected to be especially well suited for low-decoherence quantum information processing. We also discuss the experimentally promising (and perhaps already successfully realized) possibility of creating topological superconductors using semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, proximity-coupled to standard s-wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field. The goal is to provide an introduction to the subject for experimentalists or theorists who are new to the field, focusing on the aspects which are most important for understanding the basic physics.

Another feature is topologically protected gates generated through braiding of Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, braiding requires structures with branched topological segments which have inherent difficulties in the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures now believed to host MBSs. In this paper, we construct quantum bits taking advantage of the topological protection and non-local properties of MBSs in a network of parallel wires, but without relying on braiding for quantum gates. The elementary unit is made from three topological wires, two wires coupled by a trivial superconductor and the third acting as an interference arm. Coulomb blockade of the combined wires spawns a fractionalized spin, non-locally addressable by quantum dots used for single-qubit readout, initialization, and manipulation. We describe how the same tools allow for measurement-based implementation of the Clifford gates, in total making the architecture universal. Proof-of-principle demonstration of topologically protected qubits using existing techniques is therefore within reach.},
